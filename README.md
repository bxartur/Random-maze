# Random maze
Python program, that generates random maze with solution and gives hints what can be changed to make maze more interesting

# Main steps
1. Generating random maze that has only 1 path from start to end
2. Using function to show path from start to end in current maze and pointing it on maze
3. Implementing genetic algorithm with chosen parameters of current maze
4. Graphical presentation of maze with path (using turtle library)
5. Analysis of genetic algorithms work

# Example

Hints given by GA to improve current maze:
1. Make the solution path longer
2. Shorten the longest horizontal wall
3. Reduce total number of 6 or more square walls
