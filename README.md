# Random maze
Python program, that generates random maze with solution and gives hints what can be changed to make maze more interesting

# Main steps
1. Creating random maze that has only 1 path from start to end
2. Using function to show path from start to end in current maze and pointing it on maze
3. Implementing genetic algorithm with chosen parameters of current maze
4. Graphical presentation of maze with path (using turtle library)
5. Analysis of genetic algorithm work
